C++ I/O operation is using the stream concept. Stream is the sequence of bytes or flow of data. It makes the performance fast.

If bytes flow from main memory to device like printer, display screen, or a network connection, etc, this is called as output operation.

There are following header files important to C++ programs âˆ’

1	
<iostream>

This file defines the cin, cout, cerr and clog objects, which correspond to the standard input stream, the standard output stream, the un-buffered standard error stream and the buffered standard error stream, respectively.

2	
<iomanip>

This file declares services useful for performing formatted I/O with so-called parameterized stream manipulators, such as setw and setprecision.
