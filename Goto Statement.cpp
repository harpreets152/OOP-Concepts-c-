C++ Goto Statement
The C++ goto statement is also known as jump statement. It is used to transfer control to the other part of the program. It unconditionally jumps to the specified label.

It can be used to transfer control from deeply nested loop or switch case label.

C++ Goto Statement Example
Let's see the simple example of goto statement in C++.

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
ineligible:    
         cout<<"You are not eligible to vote!\n";    
      cout<<"Enter your age:\n";    
      int age;  
      cin>>age;  
      if (age < 18){    
              goto ineligible;    
      }    
      else    
      {    
              cout<<"You are eligible to vote!";     
      }         
}
